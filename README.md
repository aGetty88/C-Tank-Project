# C++ Tank Project
This is a Tank class project I made back in school.
This is a mini game that involves movement, along with firing, reloading, and ammo for the thank's cannon.
The .cpp file has the functions needed for the class, this also includes a header file
Also, there is a testing .cpp file to automatically test the program.

****** Please note that the program was built with the testing program in mind. To make it run on its own some modification maybe required.
